## Description

Laboratory facilitator for _Introductory Classical Dynamics_ and _Introductory Electromagnetic Theory_ ([Course Descriptions Here](http://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=24&poid=6488&returnto=603)). 

These freshman-level labs were designed to be exploratory --- for example, students were provided weights, strings of varying lengths, and a stopwatch and were asked to develop the formula for the period of a pendulum. It was only through testing and experiment that students were able to determine that only the length of string mattered... as long as air resistance was ignored. Interactivity was a key component of these labs, and no answers were provided, no formulas regurgitated for credit.

My responsibilities included supporting laboratory logistics, administrating demonstrations, grading weekly laboratory reports for scientific and communication competency, and supporting final exam grading including the development of a Final Exam Study Guide.

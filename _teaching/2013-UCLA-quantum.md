## Description

Teaching Assistant for [_Physics for Life Sciences Majors: Mechanics_](https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/course/2022/PHYSICS5A) and [_Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics_](https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/course/2022/PHYSICS17). 

### PHYS 6A

Introduction to kinematics, statics of motion and energy, and thermal energy with specific attention to life sciences applications. This course was taught by [Professor Shanna Shaked](https://shannashaked.wixsite.com/stemed/home) with the application of evidence-based teaching philosophies. Real world application projects asked students to develop multi-media portfolios of physics as it behaves in their own world. The course also included group exams & peer instruction. 

As teaching assistant, I was asked to develop context-rich problems for students to work on in groups in hour-long recitation sections (I taught 3 sections per week with ~25/50 students per section attending regularly). I also graded exams and projects in coordination with the other graduate instructors

### PHYS 17

A broad overview on topics of modern physics, including blackbody radiations, the Bohr atom, qualitative solutions to 2D wells, and the photoelectric effect.

As teaching assistant, I was given free reign over the hour-long recitation sections I taught each week. In alignment with lessons learned from PHYS 6A, I developed problem sets that asked students to work in groups or discuss solutions as a class. I also held office hours each week, and developed exam study guides and graded final exams.

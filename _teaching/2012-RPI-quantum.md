## Description

Teaching Assistant for _Quantum Physics I_ and _Introductory Quantum Mechanics_ ([Course Descriptions Here](http://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=24&poid=6488&returnto=603)). 

These classes were meant to be taken as a series --- PHYS 2510 covered quantum mechanical formalism which included wave mechanics and solutions to Shrodinger's equation in one, two, and three dimensions. PHYS 4100 covered the entirety of Griffiths Quantum Mechanics, including time-independent perturbation theory and scattering.

My responsibilities included holding regular office hours, grading weekly homeworks and exams, and developing solutions guides for submitted assignments. I also provided two guest lectures for PHYS 2510 ---  one as a rapid introduction to quantum mechanical operators, and one on the topic of Forier transforms.

[Abstract Here](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DNP20/Session/KM.1)

Despite years of intense focus, there is much still to learn about neutrinos. For example, the absolute neutrino mass scale and potential Majorana masses are still unknown, requiring exploration of physics beyond the Standard Model. This talk will highlight a selection of current and future efforts focused on the absolute neutrino mass through measurements of the tritium $\beta$-energy spectrum. Additionally, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay have moved to the ton-scale, spanning the isotopes available to undergo this rare process and providing information about Majorana masses of neutrinos. I will discuss advances in hardware and software techniques from several experiments including CUORE, which searches for 0νββ in 130Te using a bolometric array of TeO<sub>2</sub> crystals and is currently taking data at Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS).

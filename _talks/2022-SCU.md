Advances in quantum sensing have pushed the boundaries of what is measurable. This is particularly relevant in searches for rare events including neutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD) â€” an ultra-rare decay whose observation may have profound implications for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe. One potential search for NDBD is CUPID-1T, which proposes over 10,000 calorimeters read out from an ultra-cryogenic environment; fielding such a search will require advances not only in detector response and readout technologies such as transition edge sensors and frequency domain multiplexing, but may also benefit from additional background reduction techniques from a more advanced understanding of event reconstruction and topology at the single-detector scale.
In this talk I will present a test stand called DEMETER (Demonstrator Experiment with Multiplexed Event Topology and Energy Reconstruction) which aims to meet this need for scalable technological solutions. I will discuss how this project will advance our understanding of ultra-cryogenic & radio-pure signal readout and event reconstruction for applications in rare event searches and quantum computing, with emphasis on the continued engagement of undergraduate scholars.

CUORE Upgrade with Particle IDentification (CUPID) is a next-generation search for neutrinoless double-beta decay which will use light from cryogenic calorimeters to tag particles by their heat-to-light signal ratio. CUPID is under development at the 250 kg level, but is already looking to the next tonne stage: CUPID-1T. Scaling the next generation of crystalline detectors to this size requires tens of thousands of channels, as well as advancements in background rejection; R&D efforts underway towards this goal are discussed. We focus on the DEMETER project, a collaboration between UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory toward implementation of a multiplexed readout and event discrimination at the single-crystal level. DEMETER's modular design supports testing both Li<sub>2</sub><sup>100</sup>MoO<sub>4</sub> (scintillation) and TeO<sub>2</sub> (Cherenkov) as candidate calorimeters, as well as multiple readout schemes. We present both simulation and hardware advancements toward DEMETER, which will inform design choices for the next-to-next generation cryogenic calorimeter search for neutrinoless double-beta decay.

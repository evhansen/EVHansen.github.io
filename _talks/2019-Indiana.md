Large, ultra-low background liquid xenon detectors are a promising technology that can push the neutrinoless double beta decay search to unprecedented sensitivity. Observation of this decay would demonstrate lepton number violation and the Majorana nature of the neutrino. The nEXO experiment will search for neutrinoless double beta decay of Xe-136 using 5 tons of enriched liquid xenon in a low-background single-phase time projection chamber and is expected to reach a 10-year sensitivity of ~1028 years. I will discuss the most recent results from the precursor experiment, EXO-200, as well as techniques for light and charge calibration currently under study by the nEXO collaboration, including results from testing and simulation of dissolved calibration sources capable of characterizing the center of nEXO's large drift chamber.

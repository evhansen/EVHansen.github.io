How are formal policies put in place to create an inclusive, equitable, safe environment? How do these differ between different communities of practice (institutions, labs, collaborations, working groups)? What policies towards a more equitable community are working? For those that aren't working, what external support is needed in order to make them more effective? We present a discussion of the current climate of the field in high energy particle physics and astrophysics (HEPA), as well as current efforts toward making the community a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment. We also present issues facing both institutions and HEPA collaborations, with a set of interviews with a selection of HEPA collaboration DEI leaders. We encourage the HEPA community and the institutions & agencies that support it to think critically about the prioritization of people in HEPA over the coming decade, and what resources and policies need to be in place in order to protect and elevate minoritized populations within the HEPA community.

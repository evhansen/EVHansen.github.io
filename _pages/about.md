Hi there! I'm Erin, and I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on neutrinoless double beta decay, specifically for the CUORE and CUPID collaborations. 

### Research
I've worked in neutrino physics since 2009, and specifically on neutrinoless double beta decay since 2013 on the [nEXO](/projects/E_nEXO.md), [CUORE](/projects/C-CUORE), and [CUPID](/projects/B-CUPID) collaborations. I also lead the development of the Demonstrator Experiment with Multiplexed Event Topology and Energy Readout ([DEMETER](/projects/A-DEMETER)), which is developing multiplexed readout of superconducting sensor for next-to-next generation rare event searches.

She uses a laser to point out details on a slide labeled 'nEXO Technology Improvements' which is hard to read but has an image of the nEXO detector in the cryopit at SNO lab" style="width:267px;height:200px;display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;">


### Instruction
I'm also trained in advanced educational pedagogies, with a graduate minor in Undergraduate STEM Education and an Associate Certificate from [CIRTL](https://www.cirtl.net/).


### Community Engagement
I currently sit on the UC Berkeley Physics APS-IDEA Team / DEI Committee, and I regularly volunteer with outreach efforts including the LBNL [SAGE Summer Camp](https://k12education.lbl.gov/programs/high-school/sage). I also co-authored white papers for the [Snowmass Planning Process](/projects/D-Snowmass) which covered the Climate of the Field and Particle Physics Education. 



### Outside of the Office
Outside of research and teaching, I find my happy place rolling d20s in our regular D&D campaigns (right now I'm the DM for a Curse of Strahd game, and am playing a goliath forge cleric in IceWind Dale) and playing video games. Most recently I finished Horizon Zero Dawn, I'm working through Skyrim for the n<sup>th</sup> time. I also spoil my very fluffy cat!

Below are resources that I have found useful in my Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) efforts. Most of them have to do with statistics of why this work is important, but many also include descriptions of best practices for classrooms, departments, and communities of practice. 

At the top, you can group these selections by (among others) year, type of publication, or keyword. I have tried to key as many papers as I could to make them easier to navigate, but any constructive feedback on this page is welcome at evhansen (at) berkeley (dot) edu.

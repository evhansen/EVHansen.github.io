CUORE with Upgraded Particle IDentification:  Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in 100-Mo
===
In collaboration with the Physics Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, I lead an effort to demonstrate distinction of one- and two-electron events within ultra-cryogenic calorimeters like the lithium molybdate used in CUPID. This requires development of multiplexed signal readout at the milliKelvin scale with stringent radiopurity requirements, as well as photonic and phononic simulations and event reconstruction.

## My Work on CUPID: 


**Development of light-collecting bolometers with anti-reflective coatings:** This project continues work performed at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). CUPID will use a series of lithium molybdate scintillating bolometers to search for neutrinoless double beta decay (see all the details [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09376)). The final coating plan for CUPID is currently under development, taking into account the angular distribution of emitted scintillation photons, radiopurity, and the use of NTD or TES readouts. Using the Marvell Nanofabrication Laboratory on the UC Berkeley campus, I characterize existing SiO-Ge systems using ellipsometry and reflectometry in preparation for cryogenic tests. More advanced fabrication will include deposition of non-SiO coatings as well as characterization of coated Si bolometers.

My previous work included designing, manufacturing, and analyzing anti-reflective coatings for use with Si and Ge light detectors to improve light collection efficiency for use in scintillating bolometer detectors (e.g. CUPID). JINST 12 (2017) no.09,P09018



**Measurements of Neutron-Induced Gamma Ray Background of 100-Mo:** To examine the impact of gamma ray background due to neutron scattering of 100Mo, we conducted an experiment at the Tandem van de Graaff Accelerator at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) using a sample of CUPIDâ€™s enriched Li2100MoO4. I convene the working group of researchers from TUNL, Virginia Tech, MIT, Tennessee Tech, and UC Berkeley, and supervise the students working on analyzing beam data and calculating cross sections from neutrons at 6 MeV energy.

Demonstrator Experiment with Multiplexed Event Topology and Energy Reconstruction
===
In collaboration with the Physics Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, I lead an effort to demonstrate distinction of one- and two-electron events within ultra-cryogenic calorimeters like the lithium molybdate used in CUPID. This requires development of multiplexed signal readout at the milliKelvin scale with stringent radiopurity requirements, as well as photonic and phononic simulations and event reconstruction.


<img src='/images/DEMETER_sketch.png' alt="A simple schematic of the current DEMETER baseline design. A blue translucent cube sits in the center of the frame, with small cubic energy sensors in one corner of each face. Three thin squares align with the back left, back right, and bottom faces of the cube, and are labeled as light detectors; they also have cubic energy sensors in one corner of each detector. The infrastructure and 3 additional light detectors are not shown." >

Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events:  Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in Te-130

Details on CUORE



## My Work on CUORE:


**Multidimensional approach to the search for decays to excited states:** Previous CUORE(-0) analyses (like [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10363) and [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10702)) have set limits on the half-life of both neutrinoless and two neutrino double beta decay to excited states; such analyses can be enhanced through a spectral search. I am developing multi-dimensional cuts to identify signal and background events spread across multiple crystals with advanced patterns of energy deposition, taking into account scattered gamma events and multi-site topologies which make up a large number of previously rejected events. This search is informed by Monte Carlo simulations with cues from supervised machine learning algorithms.

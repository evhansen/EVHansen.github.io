### Abstract: 

Current experiments to search for broken lepton-number symmetry through the observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$) provide the most stringent limits on the Majorana nature of neutrinos and the effective Majorana neutrino mass (m<sub>$\beta\beta$</sub>). The next-generation experiments will focus on the sensitivity to the 0$\nu\beta\beta$ half-life of O(10<sup>27</sup>--10<sup>28</sup> years) and m<sub>$\beta\beta$</sub>$\le$15 meV, which would provide complete coverage of the so-called Inverted Ordering region of the neutrino mass parameter space. By taking advantage of recent technological breakthroughs, new, future calorimetric experiments at the 1-ton scale can increase the sensitivity by at least another order of magnitude, exploring the large fraction of the parameter space that corresponds to the Normal neutrino mass ordering. In case of a discovery, such experiments could provide important insights toward a new understanding of the mechanism of 0$\nu\beta\beta$. We present here a series of projects underway that will provide advancements in background reduction, cryogenic readout, and physics searches beyond 0$\nu\beta\beta$, all moving toward the next-to-next generation CUPID-1T detector.

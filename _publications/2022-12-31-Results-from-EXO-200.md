### On this Publication

This work presents results from an end-of run calibration campaign  on EXO-200, using two candidate isotopes: 220-Rn and 222-Rn. We report observed alpha populations, efficiency corrections, and validation of EXO-200 fluid simulations using these data.

This publication is in preparation for submission to JINST.

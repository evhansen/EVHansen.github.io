title: "Radon Injection for Light Response Calibration of the nEXO Detector"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-12-31-Radon-Injection-for-Light
excerpt: 'I present results from an end-of run calibration campaign on nEXOs predecessor experiment, EXO-200, using two candidate isotopes: 220-Rn and 222-Rn. I report observed alpha populations, efficiency corrections, and validation of EXO-200 fluid simulations using these data. This work also presents a new framework that combines fluid simulations with nEXO Monte Carlo to produce position-dependent functions of the detector response to light. Finally, I propose possible calibration schemes for radon injection for the nEXO detector.'

title: "Characterization of single layer anti-reflective coatings for bolometer-based rare event searches"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-09-18-Characterization-of-Single-Layer
excerpt: 'Combining analysis from phonon signals and photon signals is a powerful technique for reducing backgrounds in bolometer-based rare event searches. Anti-reflective coatings can significantly increase the performance of the secondary light-sensing bolometer in these experiments. As a first step toward these improvements, coatings of SiO(2), HfO(2), and TiO(2) on Ge and Si wafers were fabricated and characterized at room temperature and multiple angles of incidence.'

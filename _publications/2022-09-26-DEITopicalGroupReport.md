### Abstract: 
To achieve the highest level of intellectual excellence calls for the greatest extent of diversity. However, due to the unjust institutional and societal barriers, the field of particle physics remains as one of the least diverse fields, severely limiting the potential of our scientific achievements. In order for the US Particle Physics Community, including the accelerator science and engineering fields, to remain at the forefront of global scientific leadership, it is imperative for our community to act urgently and diligently to improve the status quo of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA).
This report summarizes the community contributions and recommendations within the Diversity and Inclusion Topical Group of the Community Engagement Frontier (CEF3) at the Snowmass 2021.

Graduate Minor in STEM education which requires advanced coursework in evidence-based pedagogies and assessment practices. 

[About the Graduate Minor](https://catalog.drexel.edu/graduate/schoolofeducation/undergraduatestemeducationgminor/)

### GRAD T-580: Foundations in Evidence-Based STEM Pedagogy
Now ISTM 511. Students in this course will discuss, research, and practice a number of evidence-based pedagogical approaches and think about implementation strategies for the classroom. Through classroom activities we will engage with a survey of evidence-based teaching approaches so that students can make informed implementation decisions after the course is over. There will be an emphasis on understanding why changes to STEM teaching are important for promoting retention and diversity in STEM fields.

### GRAD 512: Advanced Undergraduate STEM Pedagogical Techniques
Now ISTM 512. Students in this course will discuss, research, and practice a number of evidence-based pedagogical approaches and think about implementation strategies for the classroom. Through classroom activities we will engage with the vocabulary of evidence-based teaching so that students can continue to learn about these topics after the course is over. There will be an emphasis on understanding why changes to STEM teaching are important for promoting retention and diversity in STEM fields. In this course, students will address approaches to utilizing technology tools to support implementation of active-learning, confront how learning involves more than content and includes metacognition, epistemology, and affective features.

### GRAD 513: Improving STEM Education Through Research
Now ISTM 513. This course will allow students to learn the essentials of STEM education research so they can understand how to: search, read and understand the education literature to improve their approach to their teaching; develop viable research questions in STEM education; design studies to address STEM education research questions; interface with education researchers effectively; think about what is needed for effective grant writing and publication in STEM education.

### GRAD 514: Quality Assessment Practices
Now ISTM 514. This course will allow students to learn and apply best assessment practices in STEM learning environments so that they are able to: develop their own cognitive and effective STEM assessments aligned with learning objectives; utilize rubrics and scoring keys to provide students with appropriate formative feedback and grades reflective of STEM learning; suggest modifications to STEM instructional practices based on assessment data.

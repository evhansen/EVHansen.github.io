### Teaching Citational Practice: A Critical Feminist Approach (Fall 2021)
Students will study how enacting a critical-feminist approach to citational practice impact and enhance student learning. Participants will develop pedagogical resources for enacting this approach in their own classrooms and learning materials. 


### Diversity in the College Classroom (Spring 2019)
In this course, students develop practical classroom strategies that address “equity,” “inclusion,” “diversity,” and related terms.
Students consider research on bias and build a community of inquiry around ways diversity affects both our teaching and student
learning.

###  Equity in STEM for all Genders (Fall 2018)
Students will study how gender bias impacts STEM training and careers. Participants will increase awareness of gender bias
through analysis of identity, roles, and contexts where gender bias manifests in STEM university situations.
